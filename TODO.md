# Operation workflow

Since we cant communication with multiple people at the same time, we better
keep the operational workflow separately. This should reflect at what state 
our system is (mac). What do we do to respond and if we are already in the
middle of other conversation or in between states.

# Dialog workflow

The dialog workflow should be based on classical sales almanac decision matrix.
We just store the conversation history without any operation details.
